# socket_server
A little nodejs socket server use express and socket.io

* run npm i to download/install the node_modules
* run npm start to start the server
This server uses nodemon to start the server. Nodemon config is located in nodemon.json.
Nodemon will watch the /src folder for changes while developing and apply the changes immediately to the server.
* Events to listen for are defined in a controller (see roomController as a starting example).
